## Structure
This app contains 3 sites:
- Home page 
- Game/quiz page
- End page

## Features
---
### Home page: This is a basic landing page with only 3 options. Either start the game or visit 2 links provided in the page bottom. All links will open in seperate taps, when clicked. Underline is chosen to make the user recognize  the link, instead of using ex. icons.

### Game page: This design features a question displayed in the top beige box. 3 options in white-backgrounded boxes, a responsive next button, grey if inactive and blue if active. 
### "The click on your answer" box will respond depending on your answer. 
### Right bottom you'll find a quit button, taking you to the end page, displaying your current score.

### End page: Here you'll find same design as home page, containing same button design and same links. You'll be given the option though to return to the home page instead of startgame. End page does however contain a local highscore of your latest game.

## Features for future implementation:
---
- It would be considered alot more entertaining had the questions had a theme, or perhaps a common difficulty. A wider and more put together riddle content would be appreciated. 
- Displayed highscores and ability to save your score, perhaps along with either a username or 3 digit initials. 
- Responsive design when operating mouse. 

## Technologies

## Validator Testing
### HTML tested in W3C Validator
- index.html: No errors or faults.
- startgame.html: No errors or faults. 
- end.html page is showing a warning on line 13 for empty h2. This can be avoided with just about any input, and will not effect the input taken from the js file.

### Lighthouse report
Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order, Pulling accessibility down. 
No Meta was done, hence why the SEO is considered so low.
